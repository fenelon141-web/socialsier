## Image Conversion Process

If your image meets the design requirements but not technical specs:

### Step 1: Convert JPEG to PNG
1. Open image in any photo editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, etc.)
2. Save/Export as PNG format
3. Ensure no transparency is added

### Step 2: Resize to 1024x1024
1. Crop to square format (1:1 ratio)
2. Resize to exactly 1024x1024 pixels
3. Use high-quality resampling (bicubic or lanczos)

### Step 3: Quality Check
1. Zoom to 100% and check for pixelation
2. View at small sizes (simulate 29x29 pixels)
3. Verify colors look good on both light and dark backgrounds
4. Check that key elements are visible at small sizes

## Common Issues with User-Provided Images

### Photo-based Icons
- Often too detailed for small sizes
- May contain text or fine details that become unclear
- Background might not work well as app icon

### Logo Conversions
- May need background color added
- Might require simplification for mobile use
- Could need color adjustments for brand consistency

### Quick Assessment Questions

1. **Is it recognizable at thumbnail size?**
   - Open the image and zoom out until it's about the size of your thumb
   - Can you still identify the key elements?

2. **Does it match Socialiser's brand?**
   - Pink/purple color scheme
   - Modern, trendy, valley girl aesthetic
   - Social/location discovery theme

3. **Is it simple enough?**
   - No fine text or intricate details
   - Clear, bold shapes and colors
   - Works in monochrome (for accessibility)

## Recommendations

### If Your Image Works:
- Convert to PNG format
- Resize to 1024x1024 pixels
- Create all required sizes (180x180, 120x120, etc.)
- Test at various sizes before submission

### If Your Image Needs Modification:
- Simplify complex details
- Add appropriate background color
- Adjust colors to match brand palette
- Consider creating variations for different contexts

### If Your Image Doesn't Work:
- Use the provided SVG design as starting point
- Hire a designer for custom icon creation
- Use icon design tools like Canva or Figma
- Consider abstract symbols rather than detailed imagery
