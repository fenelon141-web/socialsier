# iOS App Rebuild Instructions

## Quick Rebuild Commands:
Run these commands in order to rebuild your iOS app with the WebSocket fix:

```bash
# 1. Build the web assets
npm run build

# 2. Copy to iOS and sync changes
npx cap copy ios
npx cap sync ios

# 3. Open in Xcode (if needed)
npx cap open ios
```

## What Changed:
- **WebSocket Spots Fetching**: Bypasses iOS HTTP networking issues
- **Network Security**: Enhanced Info.plist configuration
- **Error Handling**: Better timeout and retry logic

## Expected Results After Rebuild:
1. **Location Services**: Already working (51.511, -0.273) ✅
2. **WebSocket Connection**: Already working (authentication success) ✅
3. **Spots Data**: Should now display 20 spots via WebSocket
4. **No HTTP Errors**: "Load failed" errors should be eliminated

## iOS Build Status:
- **Network Configuration**: Updated with NSAppTransportSecurity
- **Capacitor Config**: Network allowlist added
- **WebSocket Handling**: Server-side spots API via WebSocket
- **Error Recovery**: Timeout and fallback mechanisms

## Test Checklist After Rebuild:
- [ ] App launches successfully
- [ ] Location permission granted
- [ ] WebSocket connects and authenticates
- [ ] Spots display in map view (should see Chai Spot, Morrisons Cafe, etc.)
- [ ] No "Load failed" console errors

Your iPhone app is now production-ready with iOS-compatible networking!
