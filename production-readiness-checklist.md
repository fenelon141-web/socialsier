2. Set up Mac with Xcode
3. Create certificates and provisioning profiles

### Priority 2: Build Production App
1. Run build commands provided
2. Open iOS project in Xcode
3. Configure signing and build for device

### Priority 3: TestFlight Testing
1. Upload to App Store Connect
2. Set up internal testing team
3. Validate all features work on real devices

### Priority 4: App Store Submission

## ‚úÖ CONFIDENCE LEVEL

**Overall Assessment:** The app is technically ready for iOS App Store submission. All code-level requirements have been met, performance is optimized, and legal compliance is complete.

**Primary Blockers:** External infrastructure (Apple Developer account, Mac/Xcode, physical devices) rather than technical implementation issues.

**Timeline Estimate:** With Apple Developer account and Mac access, could be submitted within 1-2 weeks.
