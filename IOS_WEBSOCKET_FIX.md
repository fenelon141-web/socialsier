# Final iOS Connection Fix - Network Request Issue

## Current Status:
- ✅ Location working perfectly (51.511, -0.273 with 9.7m accuracy)
- ✅ Location permissions granted
- ✅ WebSocket connecting (but unstable)
- ✅ Server finding 20 spots correctly
- ❌ HTTP API requests still failing with "Load failed"

## Root Cause Identified:
The iPhone app logs show Capacitor "not implemented" errors and network connectivity issues preventing HTTP requests from reaching the production server.

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. API Request Retry Logic
Added fallback mechanism for iOS network requests:
```javascript
try {
  // Try with credentials first
  response = await fetch(url, { credentials: 'include' });
} catch (error) {
  // Fallback without credentials for iOS
  response = await fetch(url, { /* no credentials */ });
}
```

### 2. Capacitor Configuration Updated
Added network allowlist to `capacitor.config.ts`:
```typescript
server: {
  androidScheme: 'https',
  allowNavigation: ['https://hot-girl-hunt-fenelon141.replit.app']
}
```

### 3. iOS Network Security (Already Applied)
- `NSAppTransportSecurity` configuration in Info.plist
- Domain exceptions for Replit server
- TLS v1.2 configuration

## Network Architecture Issue:
The logs show that WebSocket connects through a different network path than HTTP fetch requests in iOS. The "Load failed" errors suggest the HTTP requests are being blocked at the iOS network layer despite WebSocket success.

## Alternative Approach Needed:
Since direct HTTP requests are failing, we may need to:
1. Use WebSocket for data fetching instead of HTTP
2. Implement a different network approach for iOS
3. Test with a simpler HTTP endpoint first

## Next Test:
The enhanced retry logic should help, but if "Load failed" errors persist, we'll need to switch to WebSocket-based data fetching for the spots API.

## Debug Information:
- iPhone model: iPhone14,5 (iPhone 13 mini)
- iOS version: 18.5
- WebView version: 18.5
- Location accuracy: 9.7 meters
- Coordinates: 51.511, -0.273 (Acton, London)
- Server response: 20 spots found successfully
