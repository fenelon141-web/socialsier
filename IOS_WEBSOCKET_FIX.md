# iOS WebSocket Connection Issue - FIXED

## Problem Identified:
Multiple WebSocket connections were being created simultaneously on your iPhone, causing:
- Rapid connect/disconnect cycles
- Authentication occurring multiple times
- Spot data not being delivered to the UI
- Connection instability

## Root Cause:
The React component was creating multiple WebSocket instances, leading to connection conflicts and preventing proper data flow.

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Connection Management
- Prevent multiple simultaneous connections
- Clean up existing connections before creating new ones
- Check connection state before attempting new connections

### 2. Reconnection Logic
- Increased reconnection delay from 3 to 5 seconds
- Added checks to prevent multiple reconnection attempts
- Only reconnect if no existing connection

### 3. Enhanced Debugging
- More detailed logging for spot data flow
- Better connection state tracking
- Clearer error identification

## Expected Results After Fix:

### Stable WebSocket Connection:
```
WebSocket connected
Authenticated as user 1
[LocationWebSocket] Location tracked successfully
```

### Successful Spot Loading:
```
[MapView] API returned 20 spots
[MapView] First 3 spots: Chai Spot (341m), Morrisons Cafe (342m), Karak Chai (344m)
[MapView] Processing 20 spots for display
[MapView] Processed spots ready for render: 20
```

### iPhone App Behavior:
- Single stable WebSocket connection
- Location updates sent properly
- Spot data displayed in UI
- No more connection cycling

## Test Steps:
1. Rebuild iOS app with these fixes
2. Verify single WebSocket connection in console
3. Check that spot data appears in map view
4. Confirm stable connection without disconnects

Your location data (51.511, -0.273) and server connectivity are perfect. This WebSocket stability fix should resolve the spot display issue.
