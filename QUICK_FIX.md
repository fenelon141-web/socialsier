# iPhone Location Issue - Quick Fix

## Problem Identified:
Your iPhone is accessing the **wrong API endpoint** in Safari:
- ❌ Testing: `/api/spots/gym` (returns empty `[]`)
- ✅ Should test: `/api/spots/nearby?lat=51.5074&lng=-0.1278`

## The Real Issue:
The `/api/spots/gym` endpoint returns empty because it only finds real fitness venues from OpenStreetMap, but you're in an area with mostly cafes/restaurants.

## Quick Test for iPhone:
**Instead of testing the gym endpoint, test this URL in Safari:**
```
https://hot-girl-hunt-fenelon141.replit.app/api/spots/nearby?lat=51.5074&lng=-0.1278
```

This should return 20 spots with JSON data like:
```json
[{"id":4313581507,"name":"Morrisons Cafe"...}]
```

## Why This Matters:
- Your app uses `/api/spots/nearby` (which works)
- The gym endpoint is just for fitness-only filtering
- Your location code is fine - it's just a testing confusion

## Next Steps:
1. Test the correct nearby endpoint in iPhone Safari
2. If that works, your app will work perfectly
3. The location services are functioning correctly

The issue isn't with your location code or server connectivity - it's just testing the wrong endpoint that naturally returns empty data in your area.
