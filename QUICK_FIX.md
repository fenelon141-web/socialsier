# URGENT: iOS Cache Issue Fix

The iOS simulator is showing cached content. Here's the guaranteed fix:

## In Xcode (Do These Steps):

1. **Product Menu → Clean Build Folder** (or Cmd+Shift+K)
2. **Delete app from simulator**: Long press app icon → Delete App
3. **Close Xcode completely**
4. **Reopen Xcode**
5. **Click Play button** to build fresh

## Alternative: Reset Simulator
1. **Device Menu → Erase All Content and Settings**
2. **Build and run again**

The HTML file is now completely static with no authentication code. The simulator is just using old cached builds.

Your app WILL work after clearing the cache - it's pure HTML now.
