# ✅ REACT APP RESTORED - NO LOGIN REQUIRED

## What I Fixed:
✅ **Restored proper React app** (removed broken static HTML)
✅ **Removed useAuth from profile page** 
✅ **Fixed logout redirect** (goes to home, not login)
✅ **All routes redirect to Home** (including /login, /register)
✅ **Fresh build and iOS sync completed**

## Current Status:
- **React app working** with full functionality
- **No authentication barriers** anywhere
- **All pages accessible** immediately
- **iOS assets updated** with latest build

## Next Steps:
1. Run: `npx cap open ios`
2. Your app will open directly to the Home feed
3. All features work without login

Your Socialiser app is now demo-ready with the proper React interface and zero authentication requirements.
