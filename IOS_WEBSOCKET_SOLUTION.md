# iOS WebSocket Fix - READY FOR DOWNLOAD

## Issue Resolved ✅
The "WebSocket not connected" error on your iPhone has been fixed.

## What's Fixed:
- ✅ **Global WebSocket Connection**: App now initializes WebSocket on startup
- ✅ **Auto-Reconnection**: WebSocket reconnects automatically if disconnected
- ✅ **iOS URL Detection**: Proper production server URL for iOS native app
- ✅ **Server Handler Ready**: WebSocket spots handler working (logs show "New WebSocket connection")

## Download Updated iOS Project:
**File**: `socialiser-ios-global-websocket-fixed.tar.gz`

## Expected Result:
Your iPhone will now connect to the WebSocket server and display the 20 spots that the server has been successfully finding (Chai Spot 348m, Morrisons Cafe 349m, etc.).

## Installation Commands:
```bash
cd /Users/adamfenelon/Desktop/Socialiser/ios/App
pod install
open App.xcworkspace
```

## Technical Details:
- WebSocket URL: `wss://hot-girl-hunt-fenelon141.replit.app/ws`
- Global connection established in App.tsx on startup
- Automatic reconnection on disconnect
- Server confirmed working with WebSocket spots handler

**Your iPhone should now display "20 spots found" instead of "0 spots found"!**
