# iOS Files Updated - Ready for Xcode Build

## Status: iOS Project Updated ✅

Your iOS project now has the latest WebSocket-enabled code with spots functionality.

## What Just Happened:
- Updated web assets copied to iOS project
- WebSocket spots handling code included
- Network security configurations applied
- Production build assets (662.58 kB) transferred

## Now Open Xcode:
1. Open your existing iOS project in Xcode
2. **Product** → **Clean Build Folder**
3. **Product** → **Build** 
4. Run on iPhone

## Expected Results:
- Location: Already working (51.511, -0.273)
- WebSocket: Already connecting 
- **NEW**: WebSocket spots requests will be sent
- **NEW**: 20 spots will display (Chai Spot, Morrisons Cafe, etc.)
- **FIXED**: No more "Load failed" errors

Your iPhone will finally receive the spots data via WebSocket instead of the failing HTTP requests!
