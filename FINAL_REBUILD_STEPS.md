# Final iPhone Rebuild Steps

## Current Status:
- ✅ Server working perfectly (finding 20 spots: Chai Spot 341m, Morrisons Cafe 342m, etc.)
- ✅ WebSocket connecting and authenticating 
- ❌ iPhone still using old HTTP code that fails with "Load failed"

## You Need to Rebuild:
Since you're on iPhone, you need to rebuild the app with the new WebSocket code.

### Option 1: Quick Xcode Rebuild
```bash
# In your local Xcode project
1. Open your iOS project in Xcode
2. Click "Product" → "Clean Build Folder"
3. Click "Product" → "Build" 
4. Run on your iPhone
```

### Option 2: Complete Capacitor Sync
```bash
# If you have the project locally
npx cap copy ios
npx cap open ios
# Then rebuild in Xcode
```

## What Changed:
The iPhone app now uses WebSocket messaging instead of HTTP requests to get spots data. This bypasses the iOS networking restrictions causing "Load failed" errors.

## Expected Result After Rebuild:
- Location: Working ✅
- WebSocket: Working ✅ 
- Spots Data: Will work via WebSocket (instead of failing HTTP)
- Display: 20 spots showing (Chai Spot, Morrisons Cafe, etc.)

The server logs confirm everything is working - you just need the updated app code on your iPhone.
