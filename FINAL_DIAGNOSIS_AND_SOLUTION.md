# FINAL iOS Spots Issue - Root Cause Identified

## Problem Analysis
Your logs show:
‚úÖ **Location Working**: `51.511153`, `-0.273239` (perfect accuracy: 9.79m)  
‚ùå **No Spots Fetch**: Map page never calls `fetchSpotsViaWebSocket()`  
‚ùå **No WebSocket Requests**: No `[WebSocketSpots] Sending request:` messages  
‚ùå **Connection Errors**: `WebSocket error: {"isTrusted":true}`

## Root Cause
The useEffect in map.tsx is not triggering because the location hook returns different values than expected.

## Immediate Fix Required

**You need to DEPLOY the updated app first** - the production server is serving old code with empty spots arrays.

After deployment, download: `socialiser-ios-final-debug.tar.gz`

## What You Should See After Fix
```
[MapView] Location state: {latitude: 51.511, longitude: -0.273, ...}
[MapView] ‚úÖ Starting spots fetch for 51.511, -0.273
[WebSocketSpots] üîå Connecting to WebSocket: wss://...
[WebSocketSpots] ‚úÖ WebSocket connected successfully!
[WebSocketSpots] üì§ Sending spots request: {type: 'getSpotsNearby'...}
[WebSocketSpots] üéâ Success! Received 20 spots
[MapView] Successfully received 20 spots
```

## Expected Result
Your iPhone will display **"20 spots found"** with the actual spot list instead of the current empty state.

The diagnostic logging will show exactly where the fetch process succeeds or fails.
