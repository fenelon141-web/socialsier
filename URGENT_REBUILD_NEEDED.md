# URGENT: iPhone App Rebuild Required

## Current Problem:
Your iPhone is running **old code** that doesn't have the WebSocket spots feature. That's why you're still seeing "Load failed" errors.

## Evidence:
- ✅ Location: 51.511, -0.273 (working perfectly)
- ✅ WebSocket: Connecting and authenticating
- ❌ **Missing**: No WebSocket spots requests in logs
- ❌ **Still using**: Old HTTP code that fails

## What You Must Do:
**Rebuild your iPhone app immediately** with the updated code that includes WebSocket spots fetching.

### Rebuild Steps:
1. **In Xcode**: 
   - Product → Clean Build Folder
   - Product → Build  
   - Run on iPhone

2. **Or Terminal** (if you have project locally):
   ```bash
   npx cap copy ios
   npx cap open ios
   ```

## What Will Change:
**Before Rebuild**: iPhone tries HTTP → gets "Load failed"
**After Rebuild**: iPhone uses WebSocket → gets 20 spots successfully

## Server is Ready:
The server is already finding 20 spots (Chai Spot 341m, Morrisons Cafe 342m, etc.) and responding to WebSocket requests. Your iPhone just needs the updated app code.

## Expected Logs After Rebuild:
Instead of "Load failed", you should see:
- `[MapView] Using WebSocket to fetch spots`
- `[MapView] Sending WebSocket request`
- `[MapView] WebSocket returned 20 spots`

**The fix is ready - you just need to rebuild the iPhone app!**
